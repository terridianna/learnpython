<h1>Shelly's Shoes</h1>

<p>
  <code><b>Problem Solving</b></code><br>
  Solving problems requires knowing all of the steps needed to complete the task.
  To write programs, the computer needs these steps in order to get the job done.
  As a programmer, you will break the problem into smaller parts and solve each one separately.
</p>

<p class="instruction">
  Shelly is getting ready for school and needs to put on her shoes.
  Select the steps Shelly should take in the quiz below.<br>
  Click <code><b>view accuracy</b></code> to see the answers.
</p>

<p class="instruction">
  Now that you know what steps Shelly should take, let's write our first program.<br>
  In the sandbox below, replace each step with the correct step from the quiz.<br>
</p>

<p class="instruction">
  <code><b>Note:</b></code> make sure you type the steps exactly as they were in the quiz
</p>

<div class="content" data-datacamp-exercise data-lang="python" id="shoes1">
  <code data-type="pre-exercise-code"></code>

  <code data-type="sample-code">
    # Replace Step 1 with the first step
    print("Step 1")

    # Replace Step 2 with the second step
    print("Step 2")

    # Replace Step 3 with the third step
    print("Step 3")

    # Replace Step 4 with the fourth step
    print("Step 4")

    # Replace Step 5 with the fifth step
    print("Step 5")
  </code>

  <code data-type="solution">
    print("Check if both shoes are on")
    print("Select a pair of shoes")
    print("Start with left foot, put on left shoe")
    print("Check if both shoes are on")
    print("Put right shoe on right foot")
  </code>

  <code data-type="sct">
    test_output_contains("Check if both shoes are on\nSelect a pair of shoes\nStart with left foot, put on left shoe\nCheck if both shoes are on\nPut right shoe on right foot")
	  success_msg("Great job!")
  </code>

  <div data-type="hint">Type the correct steps between (" ")</div>
</div>


<p>
  <code><b>Comments</b></code><br>
  Did you notice that lines with an <code><b>octotroph #</b></code> in your code are not displayed?
</p>

<p class="guide">
  This is because those line are <code><b>comments</b></code>.<br>
  Comments are used as a reminder of what the code does.<br>
  Make sure to always leave comments in your code!
</p>

<p>
  <code><b>print()</b></code><br>
  In the exercise above, you used <code><b>print()</b></code> to display the steps Shelly needs to do to put on shoes.
  Print displays whatever is placed between the paranthesis.
  Let's try another print exercise.
</p>

<p class="instruction">
  In the sandbox below, add your name and your favorite color to the print statements.
</p>

<div class="content" data-datacamp-exercise data-lang="python" id="printing">
  <code data-type="pre-exercise-code"></code>

  <code data-type="sample-code">
    # Enter your name
    print("My name is ")

    # Enter your favorite color
    print("My favorite color is ")
  </code>

  <code data-type="solution">
    # Enter your name
    print("My name is Shelly")

    # Enter your favorite color
    print("My favorite color is purple")
  </code>

  <code data-type="sct">
	  success_msg("Great job!")
  </code>

  <div data-type="hint">Type your name and favorite color.</div>
</div>
